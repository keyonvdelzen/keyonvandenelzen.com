			<h1>On “Phoneless Fridays”, the smartphone, and living life.</h1>
			<p class="post-date">August 9th, 2025</p>
			<p>
				Did a phoneless Friday evening yesterday. For the second time.
				It was phenomenal.
			</p>

			<p>
				The things that emerge in the absence of boundless distraction
				are beyond valuable. Thoughts. Emotions. Ideas. Memories.
			</p>

			<p>
				I would want to live like that every day. But the downside would
				be that I wouldn't be able to make use of the modern marvel that
				is the smartphone. I would especially miss not being able to
				post to my private Insta log.
			</p>

			<p>
				But also not having access to the information that a smartphone
				provides. And the tools. Planning. Noting things down. Logging.
				Different apps: macro nutrient tracker, Hevy the workout app,
				and so many others.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, I think there's a balance to be struck. And for now, doing
				phoneless Friday evenings seems to be a good first step towards
				that balance.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wrote this on paper by the way. A blank sheet. Sitting at the
				kitchen table of my mom's place. I just cycled here from home —
				which is Den Bosch now. I've been living there for a week. I
				brought some dirty laundry with me in my backpack and put it in
				the laundry machine here.
			</p>

			<p>
				Yesterday evening I cycled, and walked, and sat. I did some
				thinking and writing and drawing on project ideas I've had for
				my new place — my sacred sleep cave, for example, and a modular
				storage closet-cabinet-bookcase. Life is good. I love life.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the rest of my time on this beautiful globe, I will pursue
				becoming as good as I can become at this thing we call “living”.
				Living life. Being good to family, friends, to people. Honing my
				skills. Working on the self. Forging strength. I will try my
				best. In every imaginable dimension. Face life's challenges
				head-on.
