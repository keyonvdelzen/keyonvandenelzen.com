			<h1>“What changed?”</h1>
			<p class="post-date">July 24, 2025</p>

			<p>
				Some days ago, you asked me, “What changed?” After you pointed
				out that I’ve been saying I’m tired lately — and that I didn’t
				used to say that. It got me thinking. And the short answer is: I
				don’t know. I’m not exactly sure what changed.
			</p>

			<p>
				The long answer is, I don’t know — but… I have some suspicions.
				Something to do with long-lost memories returning to me. When I
				wake up in the morning, my thoughts are racing. So probably at
				night, my thoughts are racing too. Probably, this is not
				conducive to a good night’s rest. I’m not sure why my thoughts
				are racing. But I do know that memories have been surfacing.
				Memories that were long long forgotten. Things I hadn’t thought
				of in years. Forgotten fragments from far away.
			</p>

			<p>
				Or maybe it’s just sleep debt quietly piling up. Or the fact
				that I don’t really take time to relax during the day. Or that I
				don’t wind down before bed. Or that I’ve gone from 3–5 cups of
				coffee a day to 6, every single day.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, short answer: I don’t know. Long answer is the same, but
				with some suspicions.
			</p>

			<p>Thanks for the insight, Paula.</p>
