			<h1>Morning walk, stretching, and flowers.</h1>

				I slept until what I think was about 07:30. I spent some time
				lying in bed, thinking, before getting up and out. The church
				bell served as my signal. However, I didn't count how many times
				it rang, so I didn't know exactly what time it was. It turned
				out to be eight o’clock. It's been at least a month since I woke
				up this late.
			</p>

				There is always some inner conflict before I go out for a
				morning walk. But it’s always lovely. After filling up my water
				bottle and emptying what I had previously consumed into the
				toilet, I opened the door on the side of the house and stepped
				out into the day. Sky gray. But some daylight was visibily
				hiding behind the clouds. In other words, gray, but not gloomy.
				It was peaceful. Barely any wind, if any at all. Birds wide
				awake, having fierce debates. Neighbour bent over his sports
				bike, fixing something before riding out into the day. “You’re
				out and about too already?”. “Yes, but I just got up”. “Ah, me
				too!”. We laughed a little and both continued our ways.
			</p>

				Into the park. I love the park. Park Ruijbosch. Especially this
				time of year. Everything is green. There’s flowers. Ducks in the
				pond. Fish in the water. Birds in the trees. A healthy
				ecosystem. Being there makes me feel connected to the world in a
				comforting way. I walked up to the tree stumps in the water. The
				ones you can hop over in order to cross over the pond. But first
				I stretched a bit. First the ankles. Right foot first. Lift it
				slightly and let it hover over the ground. Make circular
				motions, but keep the foot relaxed. Use only the muscles in your
				leg. Between three and ten rotations is good. Then the same
				number of rotations in the other direction. Clockwise or
				counter-clockwise first is irrelevant. Just keep the number of
				rotations the same. Then the other foot. Then similar motions
				for the knees, hips, spine, elbows, shoulders, neck. Then gently
				stretch some muscles. Especially bending over forward, keeping
				the legs straight, feeling the muscles in your back and neck,
				letting your hands touch the ground. Love it. And bending over
				backwards, tightening the abdomen and keeping your balance. The
				world always looks surprisingely beautiful upside down, too.
			</p>

				Anyways, after my little loosening-up and stretching routine, I
				hopped over the tree stumps to the other side of the water. In
				one fell swoop. One foot on each tree stump. Except for the one
				that is weirdly far off to the side. And it looks like it’s a
				bit rotten too, so don’t want to step on that one. Then I headed
				back home. Picked a flower on the way. Not sure what kind, but
				it’s the one with straight white petals and a bright yellow
				center. Looks lovely. I put it in the glass of water with the
				other flower I picked yesterday. I love flowers. And I love
				making a place look nice. So picking flowers and using them as
				decoration makes me feel things. And every time I look at a
				flower I picked and put in a glass of water, it doesn’t just
				look pretty, it also reminds me of where and when I picked it.
				It’s a little reminder of a lovely memory. And not just single
				flowers, of course. Bouquets too. Especially bouquets, actually.
				But single flowers have power to them too. It’s the simplicity I
				suppose.

				Next stop: Nala. She’s always super happy to see me. And I’m
				always super happy to see her too. I unlocked her cage and sat
				on the floor. She was excited. Wagging her tail, crawling under
				my bent legs and cuddling up to me. I love her. She immediately
				went for the tennis ball and wanted to play. Of course she did.
				She always wants to play. Right now she’s sleeping in my bed to
				the left of me though, as I’m sitting here typing this story
				about my morning walk. Life is good. I love life. And morning
				walks. And mornings. And Nala. And flowers. Flowers! A world
				without flowers is… I don’t know. Lifeless? No, not really. The
				world would be alright without flowers. But it’s definitely more
				beautiful with them in it. And beauty is important.
