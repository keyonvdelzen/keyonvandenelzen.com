			<h1>On failure, the fear of trying, and Minecraft.</h1>
			<p class="post-date">July 13, 2025</p>

			<p>
				This morning, I took a short walk with Nala through the park.
				The air was still, the birds were chirping, and the trees seemed
				to soften the noise of the day before it could even begin. We
				approached the little bridge over the pond, and for some reason
				it hit me — this memory from when I was a teen, playing
				Minecraft.
			</p>

			<p>
				I used to spend hours in creative mode, building little medieval
				towns, shaping landscapes, messing around, playing and even
				obsessing over little details, like the way a bridge arched over
				a river, for example. I even had a YouTube channel back then. I
				made timelapse videos of my builds and recorded mini tutorials
				on how to make things look nice — rooftops, lanterns, whatever.
				I think I was about 14 years old. And I remember it just felt
				right. I was exploring. I was following what felt interesting. I
				was making things just because I wanted to.
			</p>

			<p>
				This morning I realized… I miss that version of me. And more
				than that — I think I’ve been scared of being him.
			</p>

			<p>
				Over the past 15 years or so, I’ve tried a lot of things. Things
				I was genuinely excited about at the time:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A trampoline tricks and freerunning YouTube channel (2010)
				</li>
				<li>That Minecraft channel (2014)</li>
				<li>A computer help business (2015)</li>
				<li>A web design business (2016)</li>
				<li>
					A book I wrote on videomarketing for small businesses (2017)
				</li>
				<li>
					A period of fully pursuing life as a music artist (2018)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Some of them kind of worked. Some didn’t.<br />
				But somehow, over time, I stopped seeing them as playful
				experiments and started seeing them as a pattern of failure. And
				when you internalize failure, it starts to rot the place in you
				that creates.
			</p>

			<p>
				And that’s what I’ve been trying to name lately:<br />
				A kind of trauma around… trying.
			</p>

			<p>
				A fear of exploring. A resistance to following curiosity. A
				heaviness that sits right where the spark used to be.
			</p>

			<p>
				I think it comes from a mix of things.<br />
				Growing up gifted meant everything came easy — until it didn’t.
				I was praised for being brilliant, not for being curious. Add to
				that a mentally abusive stepdad during my teenage years, and I
				think something in me learned that effort wasn’t safe. That
				failing wasn’t allowed. That visibility meant risk.
			</p>

			<p>So I began avoiding the very things that made me feel alive.</p>

			<p>
				But the truth is — I love creating.<br />
				I love experimenting.<br />
				I love mornings, writing, messing around with blog designs,
				trying new things just because they seem cool. I love playing.
				And that word — play — has been coming back to me over and over
				again.
			</p>

			<p>
				That’s the healing.<br />
				That’s the return.
			</p>

			<p>
				Not to some version of me from the past, but to the spirit
				that’s been here all along.<br />
				Laying dormant.<br />
				Shriveled. Afraid. Almost gone.<br />
				But still there.
			</p>

			<p>
				Not return back to childhood — but forward.<br />
				To a life that includes joy again.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because when I let myself follow my curiosity without pressure —
				when I don’t demand success, or performance, or external results
				— I feel free. And that freedom is where the good stuff comes
				from.
			</p>

			<p>
				That’s what I’m practicing now, with my blog, with my private
				Instagram log, with internal exploratory conversations like this
				one. I’m learning to rebuild trust with that part of me. The one
				that builds bridges — in Minecraft, and in life.
			</p>

			<p>And maybe that’s enough for now.</p>

			<p>
				This is still forming. Assuming shape. Slowly.<br />
				I’m still forming.<br />
				But I think this might be the beginning of something
				important.<br />
				And I want to keep listening.
