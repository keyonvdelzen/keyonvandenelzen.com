			<h1>Spend time outside.</h1>
			<p class="post-date">July 22, 2025</p>

			<p>
				Spend time outside.<br />
				Without your phone.<br />
				No music.<br />
				No distractions.<br />
				Just keys to get back in the house.
			</p>

			<p>
				Go by bike, by roller skates, by foot.<br />
				Doesn't matter.<br />
				But go.
			</p>

			<p>
				Spend. Time. Outside.<br />
				In the sun, the rain, during the day, the night,<br />
				just a minute, or hours on end.<br />
				Doesn't matter.
			</p>

			<p>
				Spend time outside.<br />
				Without your phone.<br />
				No distractions.<br />
				Maybe a pen and notebook.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because valuable thoughts do emerge â€”<br />
				outside, with yourself, moving,<br />
				alone with your thoughts,<br />
				unconfined,<br />
				by walls nor modern technology.
			</p>

			<p>
				Spend time outside.<br />
				In desolate stretches of nature,<br />
				or busy city streets.<br />
				Doesn't matter.
			</p>

			<p>Spend. Time. Outside.</p>
