			<h1>Worrying, overstimulation, and social isolation.</h1>
			<p class="post-date">August 25, 2025</p>

				Another thing I've been thinking about lately, something that
				has AGAIN become apparent to me, is that my main struggle just
				seems to be that I have the tendency to get stressed out about
				things. I worry. Anxiety. And then I overexhaust myself. That
				leads to overstimulation, and eventually burnout. When things
				get bad I start to have problems with regulating my emotions, I
				tend to get in a bad mood, I start to avoid people because they
				exhaust me, that in turn leads to social isolation. I also start
				avoiding for example busy streets, or doing fun things because
				they are exhausting. Those things in turn reinforce being stuck
				in my head and worrying about stuff.
