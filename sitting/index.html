			<h1>Sitting.</h1>

        I just went outside with a little plate of food: sardines and a slice of butter.<br />
        Sat in the sun, didn't bring my phone.<br />
        Good.<br />
        No phone is good.<br />
        Outside is good.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        And I love walking, but recently discovered that sitting down somewhere is a different experience entirely.

        There’s something about not doing anything, not filling the space — just sitting — that helps my system settle.
        I didn’t realize how much I needed that.<br />
        I think I’ll do it more often.
