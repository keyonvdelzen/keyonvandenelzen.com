				A reflection on trauma loops, recovery, and the human

			<p>
				It’s strange how much clarity can come from simply having the
				right words. For years, I’ve struggled with what felt like an
				invisible trap: I’d quit smoking weed or cigarettes, start
				eating cleaner, lifting more, walking more, doing more — only to
				eventually find myself spiraling again. Fatigue would build.
				Focus would fade. Anxiety would grow. And eventually, I’d crash
				or give in and start numbing again.
			</p>

			<p>
				But now I'm starting to understand something deeper. And for the
				first time, I’m capturing it in words. Something called the
				"neuro-somatic trauma loop". It’s not just psychological. It’s
				physical. When I get tired or feel off, my body interprets it as
				a signal that collapse is coming. Because… in the past, it was.
				My nervous system has memorized what burnout felt like — and
				now, when I feel similar sensations, it launches into overdrive,
				releasing adrenaline, trying to protect me from going there
				again.
			</p>

			<p>
				The past leaks into the present. The body remembers, even when
				the mind has moved on. My nervous system can’t distinguish
				between past and present, it treats similar sensations as if
				they’re happening again, rather than just now. My system doesn’t
				see now as now. It sees now as then. And even though I’m in a
				different place, in a different time, my body hasn’t caught up
				yet. It still flinches when I look tired in the mirror. It still
				panics when my energy dips. That’s the loop.
			</p>

			<p>
				And this whole thing is becoming increasingly clear to me. It's
				a misaligned protective mechanism.
			</p>

			<p>
				So now, I’m approaching it differently.<br />
				I give my mind and body permission to pause — panoramic walks,
				deep breaths, long stares at trees and sky.<br />
				I remind myself: this isn’t 2018. Or 2019. Or any of the other
				burnouts. This is now. And I’m not the same.<br />
				I meet the early signals with curiosity instead of fear: “Ah.
				There’s that sensation. Hello again.”<br />
				I stay devoted to the slow work of untying — one knot at a time.
				Disentangling. It’s my life’s mission.
			</p>

			<p>
				In August I’m going all in.<br />
				☕ No caffeine.<br />
				💧 A water fast to start.<br />
				🥩 Continuing my shift to a carnivore lifestyle.<br />
				🛌 Prioritizing sleep, rest, and rituals.<br />
				🌾 Stepping back from the need to perform.<br />
				🚶 Walking. Being. Listening.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’m letting my system relearn what safety feels like.<br />
				And I’ll keep walking — literally and figuratively — through
				these forests, through this healing, with reverence.
			</p>

			<p>
				It’s complex.<br />
				It’s beautiful.<br />
				And I love being human.
