			<h1>A reflection on posture, unwinding old patterns, and life.</h1>
			<p class="post-date">July 12, 2025</p>

			<p>
				Here’s something I’ve been reflecting on lately — my posture
				isn’t just how I stand. It’s a record of how I’ve lived.
			</p>

			<p>
				Looking at a recent side-profile photo, I noticed a few things:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>My pelvis tilts forward</li>
				<li>My chest is slightly collapsed</li>
				<li>My head juts out ahead of my body</li>
				<li>My shoulders are a bit rounded in</li>
			</ul>

			<p>It’s subtle, but clear. And it makes sense.</p>

			<p>
				I’ve spent half my life behind a computer — 8+ hours a day on
				average, starting around age 12. That’s a lot of forward focus,
				stillness, and internalized tension. Over time, it shapes the
				body. The front collapses. Breathing becomes shallow. The spine
				molds itself around the habits of sitting and staring forward.
			</p>

			<p>
				Even though I’m naturally athletic, I can feel how my body has
				adapted to my environment.<br />
				Some of it comes from screen time.<br />
				Some from stress.<br />
				Some of it is just… life.
			</p>

			<p>
				But the biggest shift lately has been in how I relate to all
				this.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’m not forcing myself to “fix” my posture.<br />
				Instead, I’m learning to feel into it — to listen to what it’s
				been holding.<br />
				With curiosity, breath, and movement.<br />
				Letting the structure soften as the system feels safe again.
			</p>

			<p>
				And then, yes — I will rebuild it.<br />
				With intention. With rhythm. With daily practices that unwind
				old patterns and support new ones.
			</p>

			<p>
				🌀 Foam rolling has been a game-changer for my upper back — I’ve
				never felt that part of me so relaxed, so open, so light.<br />
				🧗‍♂️ Dead hangs? Phenomenal.<br />
				🧘‍♂️ And posture-correction exercises, every day — steady,
				cumulative.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’ll keep adjusting. Keep adding. Keep listening.<br />
				And most importantly… I’ll love the process.
			</p>

			<p>
				I love mornings. I love writing. I love life.<br />
				Thanks for letting me share this journey. The human experience
				is truly remarkable.
			</p>
