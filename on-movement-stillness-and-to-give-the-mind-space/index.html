			<h1>On movement, stillness, and to give the mind space.</h1>
			<p class="post-date">August 12th, 2025</p>
			<p>
				Right now I'm on the train. I just wrote the word “MOVE” on my
				thigh. Because it's mandatory. Moving. It's medicine. If I sit
				still for too long, I start feeling bad. Physically, mentally,
				spiritually.
			</p>

			<p>
				But sitting still is good too. Especially when I've been moving
				a lot. Either physically moving — i.e. literally moving, or
				mentally. When the mind has been especially active. Anxious.
				Sitting still is good. Or laying down, staring at the sky. Like
				I did this morning during my walk. I walked from home towards
				the large bridge with the view on the Verkadefabriek on one
				side, and the edge of the inner city center on the other.
				Halfway across the bridge there's a stairway winding down to the
				grass field by the river. I walked down and came across a bench
				by the water, the one I regularly saw people sitting on. It was
				empty now, though, early in the morning. It was about 6:50. I
				walked towards the bench and without much thought I decided to
				lay down on it.
			</p>

			<p>
				I stared at the sky for a bit. I closed my eyes for a bit. And I
				got lost in my thoughts for a bit. It was a phenomenal
				experience. The thoughts and feelings and memories that emerge
				in a moment of stillness like that are beyond valuable. It
				soothes the soul. It's a moment where the brain starts
				processing things. And then those things seem to emerge from the
				subconscious. I love that feeling. Emptiness. To give the mind
				space. To fill up the emptiness. With thoughts, emotions,
				memories, ideas. Good. Very good.
