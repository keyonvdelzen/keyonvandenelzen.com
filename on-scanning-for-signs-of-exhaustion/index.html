			<h1>On scanning for signs of exhaustion.</h1>
			<p class="post-date">July 11, 2025</p>

			<p>I’ve realized something lately.</p>

			<p>
				I don’t just notice when I’m tired.<br />
				I scan for it.
			</p>

			<p>
				It’s not always conscious, but it’s there — a kind of
				hypervigilance turned inward.<br />
				My nervous system, once blindsided by collapse, now wants to
				make sure that never happens again. So it checks. Preemptively.
				Repeatedly. Especially when I’ve been in adrenaline mode for too
				long, or when I’m riding on built-up sleep debt. I start
				watching myself. Studying my reflection. Looking for the first
				signs of “here we go again.”
			</p>

			<p>
				It’s the same protective instinct that makes someone with PTSD
				clock the exits in every room. But instead of scanning my
				environment, I’m scanning myself.
			</p>

			<p>And the mirror becomes part of it.</p>

			<p>
				It’s no longer just a place to see myself — it becomes a kind of
				monitoring interface. I’m not looking to connect. I’m looking to
				manage. I glance and ask questions like, “Do I look tired yet?”
				“Is my face starting to fall?” Even when the gaze is subtle, it
				carries a quiet fear.
			</p>

			<p>The same thing happens mentally.</p>

			<p>
				If my short-term memory starts slipping, or my thoughts get
				fuzzy, I don’t just notice it — I file it. As evidence. Proof
				that I’m heading there again. My nervous system takes that
				interpretation and responds with stress, releasing adrenaline —
				which only tightens the loop.
			</p>

			<p>That’s the trap: self-fulfilling feedback.</p>

			<p>
				But the more I sit with this, the more clearly I see — this
				isn’t sabotage. It’s protection.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is a system that remembers what happened when we missed the
				early cues. A system that decided: We will never be surprised
				again. And it’s trying to help… even if the help becomes
				harmful.
			</p>

			<p>
				Just capturing this in words feels like a turning point.<br />
				Because if part of the loop is how I look at myself, then maybe
				healing can begin with changing the way I see.<br />
				Noticing when I’m scanning.<br />
				Softening my gaze.<br />
				Letting the mirror reflect more than just potential danger.
			</p>

			<p>Letting it reflect me — a person. Not a problem to solve.</p>

			<p>
				There’s nothing broken about this pattern.<br />
				It makes perfect sense.
			</p>

			<p>
				And the fact that I can see it now?<br />
				That’s already loosening the knot.<br />
