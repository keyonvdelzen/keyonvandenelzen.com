			<h1>Social media is optimized to hijack my attention. ðŸ§ ðŸ§²</h1>
			<p class="post-date">August 30, 2025</p>

			<p>
				I'm nearly defenseless against the pull of my phone. It draws me
				in, <strong>traps me</strong>, entangles me. In the mornings I
				use Hevy: an app that lets me track workouts and document
				progress. That's a good thing. What gets measured gets managed.
				But it's also dangerous.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lately I've been recording myself during workouts and posting
				clips to the socials I set up for my personal brand. At first it
				was novel and exciting. Then it became a distraction. Filming is
				fine. But the editing, the captions, the hashtags... it scatters
				my attention. Suddenly I'm thinking about angles and music
				instead of sets and reps. It's fun, yes, but it drains energy.
			</p>

			<p>
				I still think recording and posting has value. I just don't want
				it in my mornings. I want my mornings to stay sacred: one thing
				at a time, focused. So here's the new plan:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Use Hevy for tracking.</li>
				<li>Film, sure.</li>
				<li>But do <strong>NOT</strong> open any social apps.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Social media apps are dangerous. Especially TikTok. But all of
				them are absolutely dangerous. They capture you. And I don't
				even scroll or consume any of the content that's on them. I just
				create and post. And check likes/comments/view counts. But even
				that side of the social media machine is so ridiculously
				addictive, it's like I'm totally powerless. I am, in fact,
				totally powerless. The only thing I can do is to not open them.
				So I will practice that: resist the temptation to open any
				socials in the morning. It'll be a sacrifice, because I like it.
				But the benefits will far outweigh the sacrifice.
			</p>

			<p>
				From what time should I allow myself to use socials to post? I'm
				not sure. For now, I'll set the boundary at midday: 12 p.m.
			</p>

			<p>How to manage using my phone without falling for the trap:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Disable airplane mode.</li>
				<li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> open any social apps.</li>
				<li>Use Dr. K's guided meditation.</li>
				<li>Use Hevy for tracking workouts.</li>
				<li>Use camera to film/take pics.</li>
				<li>I repeat: do <strong>NOT</strong> open any social apps.</li>
				<li>Finished = enable airplane mode.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>â†’ Continue morning.</p>

			<p>
				I'll experiment with keeping airplane mode on until 12 in the
				afternoon. The only thing I'll allow myself to do is posting to
				my Insta story <em>in airplane mode</em>.
