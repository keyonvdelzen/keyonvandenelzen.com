			<h1>Moving out. Stick. Caffeine-free August.</h1>
			<p class="post-date">July 16, 2025</p>

			<p>
				I’m going to move into my new apartment in Den Bosch soon. In
				about two weeks. I got the official confirmation from the rental
				agency two days ago. An hour after the viewing I had already
				sent over my personal details, a recent payslip, an employer’s
				declaration and my order of preference for the available
				apartments. I was excited. And right now I’m even more excited.
				And although I haven’t even signed the contract yet, in my head
				I’m already living there.
			</p>

			<p>
				In two weeks I’m going to be moving. But I’m not going to do a…
				“big” move. As in, renting a van, rounding up some friends to
				help carry boxes and furniture, stuffing my new place to the
				brim with all of my belongings. I don’t want that. I want
				emptiness. Silence. Peace. A reset of sorts. I want to feel the
				space. Just be with it. Sit there and let things emerge.
				Thoughts. Ideas. More thoughts. More ideas. And let other things
				submerge. Or vanish. Thoughts. Ideas. I just want to sit with
				myself and my mind for a while. I do need some bare-minimum
				essentials of course. This is what’s on my minima-list for now:
				thin inflatable camping mattress, bedsheet, pillow. So, the
				sleeping essentials. Then shower stuff and some hygiene
				products. Like a bath towel, skin cream, the basics. Some
				clothes. Stick. Yes, stick. It’s a wooden stick, literally. I’ll
				explain. There’s this tree in my mom’s backyard that’s been
				growing and growing and growing out of control over the past
				years. It’s become quite big. And we also have this
				free-standing pull-up bar next to it. I hadn’t used it for ages,
				but I wanted to use it again to do some dead hangs, some
				pull-ups, and just play around on the thing. But one of the
				tree’s branches was hanging over it. It was in the way. So I
				decided to grab the big heggeschaar from the garage and cut the
				branch off. Which left me with, well, a branch. And what do you
				do with a big branch? You have to dispose of it. Somehow. So,
				you cut it into more manageable little pieces. Which is what I
				did. But before I cut it up all the way into tiny pieces, I got
				the idea of keeping one part of about an arm’s length and a half
				and turning it into… drum roll… a stick. The one that you can
				use for everything. A scepter, of sorts. It’s about the length
				of a walking cane. Anyways, I’ve been using it for some movement
				exercises, I’ve been using it to bat some tennis balls into the
				garden for Nala to chase, I’ve been using it as a wooden sword
				for some playful movement practice, I’ve been using it in
				various ways. As a stick ought to be used. So to loop back
				around to my initial point, explaining the stick, that’s it. I
				want to bring the stick to my new place. Now, to continue my
				minimal list of things I intend to bring: foam roller, gymnastic
				rings, bike, roller skates, phone and charger, journal and pen,
				water boiler and mug and maybe a pan, a wooden cutting board and
				some cutlery. So to recap, essentials for sleeping, hygiene,
				sports, movement and working out, feeding myself, and the 21st
				century essential: phone. Ah and the journal and pen. Because
				I’ve been documenting things recently. Writing. I love it. This
				paragraph might’ve turned out to be a little longer than is easy
				to read. But whatever, I don’t care. You read it.

				Another thing that I’ll be doing at the same time I’m going to
				move into my place, is starting an experiment of quitting
				drinking coffee. I’m going to do what I call “caffeine-free
				August”. A whole month of not consuming any caffeine. Or
				drinking coffee. So, no decaf either. And no tea. The only
				things I’ll be drinking are water, water, and water. Perhaps in
				slightly different forms. Like, cold, for sure. But also hot
				water. And water with some added salt and other electrolytes.
				It’ll be good for me. I’m curious as to how I’ll feel compared
				to how I feel when I do drink coffee. After one or two weeks of
				going through the initial withdrawal symptoms, I think I’ll feel
				more balanced. In every imaginable dimension. And I think it’s
				going to do wonders for the quality of my sleep.
			</p>

				Sleep. That’s going to be my focus for August. Sleep, rest,
				relaxation. And leaning into the depths of my soul. By moving
				into the new place. By quitting caffeine. By maintaining the
				semi-strict carnivore diet I’ve been on for nearly two months
				now. By continuing my abstinence from cigarettes and weed. By
				continuing to write. By continuing to follow my curiosity and
				explore the world in a playful way. By continuing to develop the
				thing that’s been developing. The thing. It’s not really a
				thing, though. It’s hard to put my finger on. It’s a sort of
				shift in the way I operate in the world. I’ll elaborate some
				other time, but it’s related to identity. I think. It’s like…
				cultivating the different dimensions that naturally emerge from
				my soul, under the condition that I “live properly”.
			</p>

			<p>
				Anyways, I think that’s it for now. I’m sitting in front of my
				computer, at my desk, in my bedroom in my mom’s house right now.
				Nala is lying next to me on the bed to my left, sleeping. Under
				the pink blanket. I had one cup of coffee this morning. I think
				I spent about half an hour writing this. Maybe a little longer,
				I’m not too sure. Right now I’m going to post this little story
				to my personal blog website that I created recently, then have
				another coffee, chill a bit and then I’ll start the day. Brush
				teeth, shower, off to the office. Maybe I’ll have breakfast
				before leaving, but I think I’ll just skip it and bring my
				prepped meal to the office. Let’s see.

			<p>I love mornings.</p>
