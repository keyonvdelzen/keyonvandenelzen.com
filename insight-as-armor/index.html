				Hmm. Insight as armor. Using the plan to protect myself. From
				feeling uncertain. Angry about the years lost. Maybe you're
				right. But I'm not sure, honestly. I have grieved. I have been
				angry. I have allowed myself to not know. I like to think I'm
				past that now, but maybe I'm not. Maybe you're right. Maybe I
				should let myself feel that grief, truly, and be sad about it
				and cry and miss the things that I missed. Like developing
				myself, building businesses, making friends, getting a
				university degree, not letting my teeth get yellow as hell like
				they are now, without the stress and the numbing, without losing
				hair like crazy, without losing the love of my life, without
				escaping from myself, from my entrepreneurial spirit, my
				artistic drive, things that align with me, my purpose in this
				life. Let it be messy. Good advice. I'm going to try my best to
				just let things be. Sit with it. Let the emotions surface. Let
				memories surface. Cry. Laugh. Cry again. Healing can't be forced
				or planned. Healing isn't programmable. At least not fully. I'm
				not a machine rebooting into optimization. I'm a human, coming
				back to life. Thank you.

				I didn’t lose those years.<br />
				I survived them.<br />
				I built a life raft in the dark, with the tools I had.<br />
				And now — I’m stepping onto solid ground. Of my own making.
			</p>

			<p>
				Is there grief? Absolutely. <br />
				But now there’s capacity. <br />
				Now there’s clarity.

			<p>
				I’m not a machine rebooting into optimization. <br />
				I’m a human, coming back to life. <br />
				Stay steady. Let it come.
