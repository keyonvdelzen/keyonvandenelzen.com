			<h1>A different turn.</h1>
			<p class="post-date">July 17, 2025</p>

			<p>
				I woke up around 5. Or maybe a bit before.<br />
				I don’t remember exactly, but I do remember checking the time —
				just past 5 a.m.<br />
				Too early, I thought.<br />
				I had hoped to sleep a little longer, especially since I really
				need more sleep lately.<br />
				I stayed in bed for a while.<br />
				Just lying there. Thinking.<br />
				Letting my mind pull me wherever it wanted to go — though gently
				steering it when it drifted too far off into the wild. As it
				tends to do.<br />
				I thought about a bunch of things, most of which I’ve already
				forgotten.<br />
				And it’s only been 90 minutes since I was there, thinking.
			</p>

			<p>
				After half an hour or so, I figured that was enough lying
				awake.<br />
				I got up. Opened the blinds.<br />
				The world was waking.<br />
				Pastel sky. Birds chirping.<br />
				Lovely.<br />
				Shoes on. Keys, water bottle.<br />
				Quick bathroom pit stop.<br />
				Then I stepped outside. Just a little walk.<br />
				It soothes my soul, going for a walk in the morning.
			</p>

			<p>
				I thought I’d take the usual route — toward the church, down the
				little street to the right, into the park.<br />
				But I didn’t.<br />
				Instead of turning right, I went straight.<br />
				Toward the town square.<br />
				A good change.<br />
				Makes life more memorable, taking a different turn every once in
				a while.<br />
				Deliberately doing something different from what is
				routinized.<br />
				I like that.
			</p>

			<p>
				"Good morning!"<br />
				Thursday today — market day.<br />
				And early in the morning the vendors start setting up their
				little stands in the square.<br />
				There was only one guy there when I arrived. Still early. Maybe
				5:30?<br />
				I greeted him and he shouted back a cheerful “Good morning!”<br />
				Lovely.<br />
				I love market people.<br />
				They’re always so cheerful, open, warm.<br />
				Okay not always, fair — some are cranky too.
			</p>

			<p>
				I kept walking.<br />
				Past the town square.<br />
				Past the renovated old folks’ homes.<br />
				Right turn.<br />
				Toward where the old sports complex used to be.<br />
				(It got torn down a few years ago — there are houses there
				now.)<br />
				Then another right.<br />
				Eventually, I made it to the park. But this time, from a
				different direction.<br />
				Good change of pace. Makes life more memorable.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wandered through the park a little. But I noticed something in
				me — a pull.<br />
				I wanted to go back home.<br />
				Sit behind my PC. Write. Have some coffee. Wake Nala. Carry her
				upstairs. Put her beside me on the bed.<br />
				She’s next to me now.<br />
				I’m behind my PC.<br />
				Writing. Having coffee.<br />
				It’s good.<br />
				Life is good.<br />
				This morning’s been good.<br />
				I was strolling around earlier with a smile from ear to ear.<br />
				And now, I feel at peace.
